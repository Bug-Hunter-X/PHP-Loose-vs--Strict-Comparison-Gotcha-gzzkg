This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in PHP programming: the difference between loose and strict comparison. The `bug.php` file showcases the unexpected behavior that can arise from using strict comparison (===) with arrays or objects. The `bugSolution.php` file offers a solution illustrating best practices for handling comparisons in PHP.

This is important because it can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to track down. Understanding how PHP's comparison operators work is crucial to writing reliable and robust code.
